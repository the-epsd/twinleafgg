# Implementing Card Effects from Auto-Generated Stubs

You are working with auto-generated card stubs. All card stats (HP, type, weakness, resistance, retreat, attacks, cost, damage) are already filled in. Your job is to implement the game logic inside `reduceEffect()` for cards marked with TODO comments.

---

## Your Workflow

### 1. Find the TODO

Look for `// TODO:` comments inside `reduceEffect()`. The card text describing the effect is right there:

```typescript
// Attack 1: Flare
// TODO: Flip a coin. If heads, this attack does 30 more damage.
if (WAS_ATTACK_USED(effect, 0, this)) {
  // Implement effect here   <-- YOUR JOB
}
```

### 2. Search for Similar Effects (MANDATORY)

**Before writing ANY code**, search the codebase for cards with similar effects. This is the single most important step. The codebase has hundreds of implemented cards — your effect has almost certainly been done before.

**Search by card text:**
```bash
grep -r "more damage" ptcg-server/src/sets/ --include="*.ts" -l
grep -r "is now Paralyzed" ptcg-server/src/sets/ --include="*.ts" -l
grep -r "damage to.*Benched" ptcg-server/src/sets/ --include="*.ts" -l
grep -r "Discard.*Energy" ptcg-server/src/sets/ --include="*.ts" -l
```

**Search by prefab usage:**
```bash
grep -r "FLIP_A_COIN_IF_HEADS" ptcg-server/src/sets/ --include="*.ts" -l
grep -r "SWITCH_ACTIVE_WITH_BENCHED" ptcg-server/src/sets/ --include="*.ts" -l
grep -r "THIS_POKEMON_DOES_DAMAGE_TO_ITSELF" ptcg-server/src/sets/ --include="*.ts" -l
```

**Search by effect type:**
```bash
grep -r "AfterAttackEffect" ptcg-server/src/sets/ --include="*.ts" -l
grep -r "BetweenTurnsEffect" ptcg-server/src/sets/ --include="*.ts" -l
grep -r "DealDamageEffect" ptcg-server/src/sets/ --include="*.ts" -l
```

Read the matching files. Use them as your reference implementation.

**Cite your references.** When you implement an effect based on a reference card, replace the `// TODO:` comment with a `// Ref:` comment citing the file and attack name you used:

```typescript
// Single reference:
// Ref: set-emerging-powers/darmanitan.ts (Rock Smash)

// Multiple references (when combining patterns):
// Refs: set-noble-victories/stunfisk.ts (coin handling), set-noble-victories/audino.ts (self-heal)
```

This is **required** for every implemented effect. It helps reviewers verify correctness and helps future agents find examples. The `// Ref:` comment replaces the `// TODO:` line — do not leave both.

### 3. Check Text-to-Code Patterns

Read **AGENTS-patterns.md** in this directory. It maps common card text phrases directly to code, covering drawing, special conditions, coin flips, damage, healing, switching, energy, searching, and more.

### 4. Implement Using Prefabs

Always prefer prefab functions over custom logic. Read **CLAUDE-prefabs.md** for the complete list of available prefabs with signatures.

### 4.5 Public vs Private Knowledge (Search Rules)

This is a core rules concept and must be handled correctly:

- **Private knowledge zones** (usually the deck): if card text asks you to find a specific subset (for example, "a Pokemon", "2 Basic Energy"), the player may select fewer than requested or fail, because the opponent cannot verify deck contents.
- **Public knowledge zones** (discard, in-play, etc.): required counts are mandatory unless text says "up to".
- **Known guaranteed target in private zone**: if text is broad enough that a legal target is guaranteed when the zone is non-empty (for example, "search your deck for a card"), do not allow failing.

Examples:
- `Computer Search` ("a card") should be mandatory when the deck has cards.
- `Ultra Ball` style Pokemon search can fail, because deck contents are private.
- Discard-pile retrieval should follow exact counts unless the card says "up to".

### 5. Verify Compilation

After implementing cards, run:
```bash
cd ptcg-server && npx tsc --noEmit
```

---

## Critical Effect Timing

**This is the #1 source of bugs.** Use the correct effect type based on WHEN the effect occurs:

| Effect Type | When It Fires | Use For |
|-------------|---------------|---------|
| `AttackEffect` / `WAS_ATTACK_USED` | **Before** damage | Modifying damage, paying costs, setting flags |
| `AfterAttackEffect` | **After** damage | Switching Pokemon, effects that happen post-damage |

### WRONG (switches before damage is dealt):
```typescript
if (WAS_ATTACK_USED(effect, 0, this)) {
  SWITCH_ACTIVE_WITH_BENCHED(store, state, opponent); // BUG!
}
```

### CORRECT (switches after damage):
```typescript
public usedMyAttack = false;

if (WAS_ATTACK_USED(effect, 0, this)) {
  this.usedMyAttack = true;
}

if (effect instanceof AfterAttackEffect && this.usedMyAttack) {
  SWITCH_ACTIVE_WITH_BENCHED(store, state, opponent);
}

if (effect instanceof EndTurnEffect) {
  this.usedMyAttack = false;
}
```

For the full effect timing reference, read **CLAUDE-effects.md**.

---

## When to Restructure the Stub

The generated stub uses `WAS_ATTACK_USED` and `WAS_POWER_USED` as starting points. These are correct for most cases, but some effects need restructuring:

### Passive Abilities (between turns, damage interception)

The stub generates:
```typescript
if (WAS_POWER_USED(effect, 0, this)) {
  // Implement ability here
}
```

But `WAS_POWER_USED` only works for **activated** abilities (player clicks to use). Passive abilities that trigger automatically need a different approach:

- **"Between turns" abilities** (e.g., "heal 10 damage between turns") → Intercept `BetweenTurnsEffect`
- **Damage modification abilities** (e.g., "reduce damage by 20") → Intercept `DealDamageEffect`
- **Always-on type changes** → Intercept `CheckProvidedEnergyEffect`

**Delete the `WAS_POWER_USED` block and replace it** with the appropriate effect intercept. Search for similar abilities in the codebase for the right pattern.

### Post-Damage Attack Effects

If the attack text says something happens **after** damage (switching, healing based on damage dealt), restructure to use the `AfterAttackEffect` flag pattern shown above.

---

## Self-Attack Restrictions

For "can't use [Attack] next turn" — use the built-in system (NO cleanup needed):
```typescript
if (WAS_ATTACK_USED(effect, 0, this)) {
  player.active.cannotUseAttacksNextTurnPending.push('Attack Name');
}
```

For "can't attack next turn":
```typescript
if (WAS_ATTACK_USED(effect, 0, this)) {
  player.active.cannotAttackNextTurnPending = true;
}
```

---

## Marker Cleanup

Every marker you add MUST be cleaned up in `EndTurnEffect`:
```typescript
if (effect instanceof EndTurnEffect) {
  effect.player.marker.removeMarker(this.MY_MARKER, this);
}
```

## "Once During Your Turn" Abilities

Use the dedicated prefab for activated abilities:
```typescript
if (WAS_POWER_USED(effect, 0, this)) {
  const player = effect.player;
  // card-specific validation first...
  USE_ABILITY_ONCE_PER_TURN(player, this.MY_ABILITY_MARKER, this);
  ABILITY_USED(player, this);
  // ability effect...
}

REMOVE_MARKER_AT_END_OF_TURN(effect, this.MY_ABILITY_MARKER, this);
```

---

## Key Prefabs Quick Reference

## Important Rules

1. **Always return `state`** from `reduceEffect()`
2. **Use prefabs first** — search before writing custom logic
3. **Check ability locks** with `IS_ABILITY_BLOCKED()` before ability effects
4. **Energy shorthand in properties, `CardType.TYPE` in logic** — Use `G`, `R`, `W` in card properties (already in stubs). Use `CardType.GRASS`, `CardType.FIRE`, `CardType.WATER` inside `reduceEffect()` logic.
5. **Clean up markers** on `EndTurnEffect` — every marker must be removed
6. **`effect.preventDefault = true`** to block effects
7. **Never modify state directly** — use `store.reduceEffect()` to dispatch sub-effects
8. **Energy symbols in text** — Use `[G]`, `[R]`, `[W]`, `[L]`, `[P]`, `[F]`, `[D]`, `[M]` instead of "Grass", "Fire", etc.
9. **Cite your references** — Replace `// TODO:` with `// Ref: set-name/file.ts (Attack Name)` for every implemented effect

## Gotchas & Learnings

### "Until the end of your next turn" requires 2-phase marker cleanup

Single-marker patterns only persist through the opponent's turn. To persist through the attacker's NEXT turn, you need the 2-phase pattern:

```typescript
public readonly EFFECT_TURN1_MARKER = 'EFFECT_TURN1_MARKER';
public readonly CLEAR_EFFECT_MARKER = 'CLEAR_EFFECT_MARKER';

// On attack: add phase-1 marker
if (WAS_ATTACK_USED(effect, 0, this)) {
  player.marker.addMarker(this.EFFECT_TURN1_MARKER, this);
  // ... apply the effect (e.g., add ability-blocking marker to opponent)
}

// EndTurnEffect: phase transition
if (effect instanceof EndTurnEffect) {
  // Phase 1 → Phase 2 (at end of current turn)
  REPLACE_MARKER_AT_END_OF_TURN(effect, this.EFFECT_TURN1_MARKER, this.CLEAR_EFFECT_MARKER, this);
  // Phase 2 → cleanup (at end of next turn)
  if (effect.player.marker.hasMarker(this.CLEAR_EFFECT_MARKER, this)) {
    effect.player.marker.removeMarker(this.CLEAR_EFFECT_MARKER, this);
    // ... remove the applied effect
  }
}
```

Reference: `set-great-encounters/dialga-lv-x.ts`

### ATTACH_ENERGY_PROMPT doesn't support conditional post-attachment logic

When a card says "If you attached Energy in this way, then [do something]", you cannot use the `ATTACH_ENERGY_PROMPT` prefab because it doesn't expose whether attachment actually happened. Inline the `AttachEnergyPrompt` logic and set the flag inside the callback when `transfers.length > 0`.

### IS_ABILITY_BLOCKED is mandatory for ALL ability types

Both activated abilities (`WAS_POWER_USED`) and passive abilities (e.g., `DealDamageEffect` intercepts) MUST check `IS_ABILITY_BLOCKED()` before applying their effect. Missing this check means the ability works even under Silent Lab or Garbodor's Garbotoxin.

### ChooseCardsPrompt `differentTypes` option

When card text says "X different types of basic Energy cards", use `differentTypes: true` in the `ChooseCardsPrompt` options. Reference: `set-surging-sparks/energy-search-pro.ts`.

### Ability-based evolution doesn't dispatch EvolveEffect

Cards like Inkay's "Upside-Down Evolution" that evolve via ability use manual `moveCardTo` + `clearEffects` + `pokemonPlayedTurn`. This means other cards intercepting `EvolveEffect` won't see the evolution. This is the established pattern — see `CLAUDE-effects.md`.

### Active-slot verification for abilities that check conditions

If an ability checks the active Pokemon's state (e.g., "if this Pokemon is Confused"), verify that `this` card is actually in the active slot using `StateUtils.findCardList(state, this)`. Otherwise the ability could trigger from the bench based on a different Pokemon's condition.

### "Opponent can't draw at beginning of next turn" pattern

`DrewTopdeckEffect` fires AFTER the card is already moved from deck to hand, so `preventDefault` does nothing. Instead, intercept `BeginTurnEffect` and throw `GameError(GameMessage.BLOCKED_BY_EFFECT)`. The `initNextTurn` function catches the exception and skips the draw while allowing the turn to proceed. Reference: `set-flashfire/luvdisc.ts` (Heart Wink).

### Ability-only sleepFlips modification

When the 2-coin sleep mechanic is part of an ability (e.g., Snorlax's "Stir and Snooze"), do NOT pass `sleepFlips` from the attack's `ADD_SLEEP_TO_PLAYER_ACTIVE` call. The ability's `BetweenTurnsEffect` handler should be the sole source of the `sleepFlips` override — this ensures the mechanic reverts to normal when the ability is blocked. Reference: `set-flashfire/snorlax.ts`.

### Activated abilities MUST have IS_ABILITY_BLOCKED check

Every `WAS_POWER_USED` handler (activated abilities) must include an `IS_ABILITY_BLOCKED` check immediately after entering the block. Without this, the ability bypasses Garbodor's Garbotoxin, Silent Lab, etc.

```typescript
if (WAS_POWER_USED(effect, 0, this)) {
  const player = effect.player;

  if (IS_ABILITY_BLOCKED(store, state, player, this)) {
    throw new GameError(GameMessage.BLOCKED_BY_EFFECT);
  }

  // ... rest of ability logic
}
```

Note: Passive abilities (effect interception) also need `IS_ABILITY_BLOCKED` but handle it differently — they `return state` instead of throwing.

### Passive abilities should NOT have `useWhenInPlay: true`

Only activated abilities (those using `WAS_POWER_USED`) should have `useWhenInPlay: true`. Passive abilities that intercept effects automatically (DealDamageEffect, CheckPokemonStatsEffect, etc.) should omit this flag. See AGENTS-patterns.md for details.

### Two versions of HEAL_X_DAMAGE_FROM_THIS_POKEMON

Two versions exist with different argument orders — match the import source to the argument order:
- `prefabs/attack-effects.ts`: `HEAL_X_DAMAGE_FROM_THIS_POKEMON(damage, effect, store, state)`
- `prefabs/prefabs.ts`: `HEAL_X_DAMAGE_FROM_THIS_POKEMON(effect, store, state, damage)`

### DISCARD_TOP_X_CARDS_FROM_YOUR_DECK sourceEffect convention

The `sourceEffect` parameter should always be `effect` (the full AttackEffect), not `effect.attack` (the Attack object). While both work because the parameter is typed as `any`, passing `effect` is the established codebase convention.

### Programmatic tool attachment (non-standard sources)

When attaching tools to Pokemon programmatically (e.g., from deck, not through normal play), you must manually move the card from `cards` to `tools`:
```typescript
source.moveCardTo(tool, target);
const idx = target.cards.indexOf(tool);
if (idx !== -1) { target.cards.splice(idx, 1); }
target.tools.push(tool);
```
This mirrors what `play-trainer-effect.ts` does internally. Without the splice, the tool ends up in both arrays.

### "Attach to opponent" tools (Team Flare Hyper Gear)

Tools like Head Ringer and Jamming Net that attach to opponent's Pokemon-EX must intercept `PlayItemEffect` (not `TrainerEffect`) to bypass the normal tool attachment flow which only attaches to your own Pokemon. Reference: `set-phantom-forces/head-ringer-team-flare-hyper-gear.ts`, `set-phantom-forces/jamming-net-team-flare-hyper-gear.ts`.

### `DISCARD_UP_TO_X_TYPE_ENERGY` is for OPTIONAL discards only

`DISCARD_UP_TO_X_TYPE_ENERGY_FROM_YOUR_POKEMON` defaults to `minAmount: 0`, making the discard optional. When card text says "Discard all [type] Energy attached to this Pokemon" (mandatory), use a manual pattern that filters and discards without choice:

```typescript
// "Discard all [L] Energy attached to this Pokemon."
const cards = player.active.cards.filter(c => c instanceof EnergyCard && c.provides.includes(CardType.LIGHTNING));
cards.forEach(c => { player.active.moveCardTo(c, player.discard); });
```

Reference: `set-x-and-y/talonflame.ts`, `set-primal-clash/manectric.ts`

### "If the Defending Pokemon is damaged, it is Knocked Out" pattern

Use `CheckHpEffect` to get the target's HP, then set `effect.damage = checkHp.hp` in a `DealDamageEffect` handler. Do NOT directly mutate `effect.target.damage` during effect handling — that corrupts the engine's damage tracking.

```typescript
if (effect instanceof DealDamageEffect && effect.damage > 0
  && effect.target.marker.hasMarker(this.KO_MARKER, this)) {
  const checkHp = new CheckHpEffect(effect.player, effect.target);
  store.reduceEffect(state, checkHp);
  effect.damage = checkHp.hp;
}
```

Reference: `set-primal-clash/beedrill.ts` (Allergic Shock)

### Moving tools between Pokemon

Tools live in a separate `tools` array, not `cards`. When moving a tool from one Pokemon to another, you must splice from `source.tools`, use `moveCardTo`, then splice from `dest.cards` and push to `dest.tools`:

```typescript
const toolIdx = source.tools.indexOf(tool);
if (toolIdx !== -1) { source.tools.splice(toolIdx, 1); }
source.moveCardTo(tool, dest);
const cardIdx = dest.cards.indexOf(tool);
if (cardIdx !== -1) { dest.cards.splice(cardIdx, 1); }
dest.tools.push(tool);
```

Reference: `set-primal-clash/mr-mime.ts` (Trick)

### Never use `(c as any)` to bypass TypeScript types

Always import the correct type (e.g., `EnergyCard`, `PokemonCard`, `TrainerCard`) instead of using `as any` casts. If you need to check `energyType`, import `EnergyCard` and use `c instanceof EnergyCard && c.energyType === EnergyType.SPECIAL`.

### `getPokemons()` vs `getPokemonCard()` — evolution chain handling

When filtering "cards attached to a Pokemon" (energy + tools), always use `getPokemons()` to exclude the **entire evolution chain**, not `getPokemonCard()` which only returns the **top** evolution card. Using `getPokemonCard()` on an evolved Pokemon (e.g., Stage 2) will incorrectly treat pre-evolution cards as "attached cards."

```typescript
// WRONG: Only excludes the top Pokemon card
const pokemonCard = cardList.getPokemonCard();
const attached = cardList.cards.filter(c => c !== pokemonCard);

// CORRECT: Excludes all Pokemon in the evolution chain
const pokemons = cardList.getPokemons();
const attached = cardList.cards.filter(c => !pokemons.includes(c as PokemonCard));
```

### Delayed KO timing: "end of opponent's next turn" vs "during your next turn"

These two timings require different marker placements:

- **"At the end of your opponent's next turn"** → Place marker on `opponent.marker` (single-phase). The marker is set during your turn, skips your EndTurnEffect (wrong player), then triggers at end of opponent's turn.
- **"During your next turn"** → Place marker on `player.marker` (2-phase with `REPLACE_MARKER_AT_END_OF_TURN`). Needs to persist across opponent's entire turn.

Reference: `set-roaring-skies/jirachi.ts` (Doom Desire) for opponent's-turn timing.

### On-evolve abilities must NOT have `useWhenInPlay: true`

On-evolve abilities handled by `JUST_EVOLVED` (which intercepts `EvolveEffect`) should NOT have `useWhenInPlay: true` in their power definition. Only activated abilities (those using `WAS_POWER_USED`) should have `useWhenInPlay: true`. Adding it to on-evolve abilities creates a non-functional "Use Ability" button in the game UI.

### Mandatory vs optional prompts for public knowledge zones

When card text says "Attach a basic Energy card from your discard pile to this Pokemon" (no "you may" or "up to"), the discard pile is public knowledge — the prompt must use `min: 1, allowCancel: false`. Only use `min: 0, allowCancel: true` when the card text says "you may" or the source zone is private (deck).

### Tool removal to hand/discard: don't manually splice before moveCardTo

When removing a tool from a Pokemon to send it to hand or discard, do NOT manually splice from `tools` before calling `moveCardTo`. The `moveCardTo` method checks `this.cards` first, then falls back to `this.tools`. If you splice the tool out of `tools` first, `moveCardTo` won't find it in either array and the card is lost.

```typescript
// WRONG: Card is lost — moveCardTo can't find it
const idx = target.tools.indexOf(tool);
target.tools.splice(idx, 1);
target.moveCardTo(tool, player.hand); // Fails silently

// CORRECT: Let moveCardTo handle the removal
target.moveCardTo(tool, player.hand);
```

Reference: `set-fates-collide/genesect-ex.ts` (Drive Change)

### `ignoreWeakness`/`ignoreResistance` vs `THIS_ATTACKS_DAMAGE_ISNT_AFFECTED_BY_EFFECTS`

These are different things:
- **"not affected by Weakness or Resistance"** → Set `effect.ignoreWeakness = true; effect.ignoreResistance = true;`
- **"not affected by any effects on the Defending Pokemon"** → Use `THIS_ATTACKS_DAMAGE_ISNT_AFFECTED_BY_EFFECTS(store, state, effect, baseDamage)` which bypasses ALL defensive effects but still applies Weakness/Resistance

Do NOT use `THIS_ATTACKS_DAMAGE_ISNT_AFFECTED_BY_EFFECTS` when the card only says "not affected by Weakness or Resistance".

### Deck placement: `unshift()` = top, `push()` = bottom

In the card list arrays, the beginning (index 0) is the top of the deck:
- `deck.cards.unshift(card)` or moving to index 0 = **top of deck**
- `deck.cards.push(card)` = **bottom of deck**

When card text says "put on the bottom of the deck", use `push()`.

### Discard is not KnockOut — no prizes

When card text says "discard the Defending Pokemon and all cards attached to it", this is NOT a KnockOut. Do not use `KnockOutEffect`. Discarding does not award prize cards. Instead, manually move all cards to the discard pile.

Reference: `set-ancient-origins/unown.ts` (Farewell Letter pattern)

### Energy card names must match exactly

Basic energy card names are: `Fire Energy`, `Water Energy`, `Grass Energy`, `Lightning Energy`, `Psychic Energy`, `Fighting Energy`, `Darkness Energy`, `Metal Energy`, `Fairy Energy`. Common mistake: using "Dark Energy" instead of "Darkness Energy".

### `SHUFFLE_CARDS_INTO_DECK` does NOT remove cards from source

The `SHUFFLE_CARDS_INTO_DECK` prefab only adds cards to the deck via `unshift` and shuffles — it does NOT remove them from their source location (discard, hand, etc.). You must remove cards from the source first, or use `moveCardTo` + `SHUFFLE_DECK` instead:

```typescript
// WRONG: Cards exist in both discard AND deck (duplication bug)
const cards = player.discard.cards.filter(c => /* ... */);
SHUFFLE_CARDS_INTO_DECK(store, state, player, cards);

// CORRECT: Move first, then shuffle
cards.forEach(c => { player.discard.moveCardTo(c, player.deck); });
return SHUFFLE_DECK(store, state, player);
```

### `BLOCK_RETREAT` marker must use `MarkerConstants.DEFENDING_POKEMON_CANNOT_RETREAT_MARKER`

When using the 3-call BLOCK_RETREAT pattern, `BLOCK_RETREAT_IF_MARKER` and `REMOVE_MARKER_FROM_ACTIVE_AT_END_OF_TURN` must use `MarkerConstants.DEFENDING_POKEMON_CANNOT_RETREAT_MARKER` — the exact marker that `BLOCK_RETREAT()` sets internally. Custom marker names will silently fail to block retreat.

```typescript
import { MarkerConstants } from '../../game/store/prefabs/prefabs';

// In WAS_ATTACK_USED: set the marker
BLOCK_RETREAT(player, opponent, effect);

// In CheckRetreatCostEffect: enforce block
BLOCK_RETREAT_IF_MARKER(effect, this, MarkerConstants.DEFENDING_POKEMON_CANNOT_RETREAT_MARKER);

// In EndTurnEffect: clean up
REMOVE_MARKER_FROM_ACTIVE_AT_END_OF_TURN(effect, MarkerConstants.DEFENDING_POKEMON_CANNOT_RETREAT_MARKER, this);
```

### Tool presence: check `tools[]` not `cards[]`

Tools are stored in `PokemonCardList.tools`, not `PokemonCardList.cards`. To check if a Pokemon has a tool attached:

```typescript
// CORRECT
if (target.tools.length > 0) { /* has tool */ }

// WRONG: tools are NOT in cards[]
if (target.cards.some(c => c instanceof TrainerCard && c.trainerType === TrainerType.TOOL)) { /* never finds tools */ }
```

### `REPLACE_MARKER_AT_END_OF_TURN` only checks `effect.player.marker`

The `REPLACE_MARKER_AT_END_OF_TURN` prefab checks `effect.player.marker` — meaning it only fires during the EndTurnEffect of the player whose marker object holds the marker. Place the phase-1 marker on the correct player:

- **"Until end of your next turn"** → Place on `player.marker` (attacker). Transitions at end of attacker's turn, cleans up at end of attacker's next turn.
- **"Until end of opponent's next turn"** → Place on `player.marker` (attacker), NOT `opponent.marker`. Phase-1 transitions at end of attacker's turn; phase-2 cleans up at end of attacker's next turn (which is after opponent's turn). The blocking checks should inspect both players' markers.

### "During your opponent's next turn" needs 2-marker cleanup pattern

Simple `EndTurnEffect` cleanup fires at the end of EVERY player's turn. For effects that last "during your opponent's next turn", you must use a CLEAR marker on the opponent's player marker so cleanup fires only at the end of the opponent's turn:

```typescript
// On attack:
player.active.marker.addMarker(this.EFFECT_MARKER, this);
opponent.marker.addMarker(this.CLEAR_EFFECT_MARKER, this);  // <-- THIS IS KEY

// Cleanup (fires only at end of opponent's turn):
if (effect instanceof EndTurnEffect
  && effect.player.marker.hasMarker(this.CLEAR_EFFECT_MARKER, this)) {
  effect.player.marker.removeMarker(this.CLEAR_EFFECT_MARKER, this);
  const opponent = StateUtils.getOpponent(state, effect.player);
  opponent.forEachPokemon(PlayerType.TOP_PLAYER, cardList => {
    cardList.marker.removeMarker(this.EFFECT_MARKER, this);
  });
}
```

Without the CLEAR marker, the effect gets cleaned up at the end of YOUR turn before the opponent can even attack. Reference: `set-steam-siege/seedot.ts`, `set-evolutions/gastly.ts`.

### On-play-from-hand abilities should NOT have `useWhenInPlay: true`

Abilities that trigger when played from hand (intercepting `PlayPokemonEffect`) should NOT have `useWhenInPlay: true`. Only activated abilities that a player clicks to use should have this flag. This also applies to passive abilities (see existing gotcha above).

### 2-phase marker ordering: REMOVE before REPLACE

When using the 2-phase marker pattern for "until the end of your next turn" effects, the order of `REMOVE_MARKER_AT_END_OF_TURN` and `REPLACE_MARKER_AT_END_OF_TURN` calls is critical. REMOVE must come before REPLACE:

```typescript
// CORRECT ordering:
REMOVE_MARKER_AT_END_OF_TURN(effect, this.CLEAR_MARKER, this);
REPLACE_MARKER_AT_END_OF_TURN(effect, this.MARKER, this.CLEAR_MARKER, this);
```

If REPLACE comes before REMOVE, the newly-created CLEAR marker gets immediately removed in the same EndTurnEffect pass, causing the effect to last only one turn instead of two.

Also: when checking whether the effect is active, check BOTH phase markers, since the effect persists through both phases.

### `PokemonCardList.tools` is a separate array from `cards`

Tools attached to a Pokemon are stored in `PokemonCardList.tools`, not in `PokemonCardList.cards`. When implementing effects that move "all cards attached to a Pokemon" (return to hand, discard all, etc.), you must handle both arrays:

```typescript
const tools = cardList.tools.slice();
tools.forEach(card => { cardList.moveCardTo(card, destination); });
const cards = cardList.cards.slice();
cards.forEach(card => { cardList.moveCardTo(card, destination); });
```

### `cards[0]` is NOT the top Pokemon in an evolution stack

`PokemonCardList.cards[0]` is the Basic Pokemon at the bottom of the evolution line. For Stage 1+ Pokemon, `cards[0]` is NOT the current Pokemon. Use `getPokemonCard()` to get the current (top) Pokemon:

```typescript
// WRONG: For evolved Pokemon, this is the Basic, not the Stage 1/2
if (player.active.cards[0] === this) { ... }

// CORRECT: Gets the topmost Pokemon card
if (player.active.getPokemonCard() === this) { ... }
```

### Effect intercepts MUST verify `getPokemonCard() === this`

When intercepting effects like `DealDamageEffect`, `PutDamageEffect`, or `PutCountersEffect` for a specific Pokemon, always verify BOTH that the card is in the target AND that it's the active (top) Pokemon:

```typescript
// WRONG: Triggers even if this card is under an evolution
if (effect.target.cards.includes(this)) { ... }

// CORRECT: Ensures this card is the current Pokemon
if (effect.target.cards.includes(this) && effect.target.getPokemonCard() === this) { ... }
```

### Boolean flags for AfterAttackEffect MUST have EndTurnEffect cleanup

When using a boolean flag (e.g., `this.usedAttack = true`) to coordinate between `WAS_ATTACK_USED` and `AfterAttackEffect`, always add an `EndTurnEffect` cleanup block to reset the flag. If the `AfterAttackEffect` handler is skipped for any reason, the flag persists to the next turn:

```typescript
if (effect instanceof EndTurnEffect) {
  this.usedAttack = false;
}
```

### Generator trainers: never call `next()` outside of prompt callbacks

In generator-pattern Supporter/Item cards, only call `next()` (which calls `generator.next()`) from inside prompt callbacks. Calling `next()` synchronously in an `else` branch while the generator is already running causes `TypeError: Generator is already running`. If a `yield` is conditional, let the generator flow naturally without an else branch. Reference: Shauna XY pattern.

### "Prevent all effects of attacks" abilities must use `AbstractAttackEffect`

When a card says "Prevent all effects of attacks, including damage, done to this Pokemon by [condition]", intercept `AbstractAttackEffect` — not just `PutDamageEffect` or `DealDamageEffect`. `AbstractAttackEffect` is the parent class of all attack sub-effects and catches damage, special conditions, and other effects. Reference: `set-cosmic-eclipse/alolan-persian-gx.ts` (Smug Face).

### First-turn checks: `state.turn <= 2`, not `state.turn <= 1`

For "during your first turn" effects, use `state.turn <= 2`. Turn 1 is the first player's first turn, turn 2 is the second player's first turn. Using `state.turn <= 1` misses the going-second player entirely.

### `BLOCK_RETREAT()` returns State — always `return` the result

`BLOCK_RETREAT(store, state, effect, this)` dispatches a sub-effect via `store.reduceEffect` and returns `State`. Always capture and return the result: `return BLOCK_RETREAT(store, state, effect, this);`. Discarding the return value can lose state mutations.

### Public-zone mandatory selection: `min` must equal `max`

For effects that select cards from a public zone (discard pile), `min` should equal `max` (the computed available amount) when the card text doesn't say "up to". The opponent can verify the count in public zones. Only use `min: 1` when the source is private (deck) or text says "up to". Reference: `set-burning-shadows/ho-oh-gx.ts` (Eternal Flame-GX).

### AttachEnergyPrompt `validCardTypes` for type-restricted moves

When card text says "Move a [X] Energy", use `validCardTypes: [CardType.X]` in AttachEnergyPrompt options to restrict which energy type can be selected. Without this, players can move any energy type. Reference: `set-burning-shadows/simipour.ts` (Aqua Reflect).

### Verify evolution stage matches `evolvesFrom` after stub generation

The stub generator may incorrectly set `Stage.BASIC` for evolved Pokemon (especially when card data comes from TCGdex). Always verify: if `evolvesFrom` is present, the stage should be `Stage.STAGE_1` or `Stage.STAGE_2`, not `Stage.BASIC`. This was the most common bug found during set-shining-legends review (11 out of 37 cards affected).

### Passive abilities: use `IS_ABILITY_BLOCKED` prefab, not manual `PowerEffect` try/catch

For passive abilities that intercept effects (e.g., `PutDamageEffect`, `DealDamageEffect`, `RetreatEffect`), use `IS_ABILITY_BLOCKED(store, state, player, this)` followed by `return state` instead of the manual `try { new PowerEffect(...) } catch { return state }` pattern. The prefab is cleaner and the established preferred pattern.
